## Welcome

-   this session is [ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶]{style="color:red;"}, so it's designed for intermediate users with plenty of previous Excel Pivot Table experience
- this session is **not** a general introduction to Pivot Tables in Excel


## Future sessions {.smaller}

```{r}
KINDR::training_sessions(tr_type = "Power Platform", start_date = params$date, n = 5)
```


## Session outline

-   check that you have Power Pivot please!
    - useful [guide for M365](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/start-the-power-pivot-add-in-for-excel-a891a66d-36e3-43fc-81e8-fc4798f39ea8)
    - [PowerPivot infrastructure varies widely](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/where-is-power-pivot-aa64e217-4b6e-410b-8337-20b87e1c2a4b), so we can't advise on installation
-   find and tidy some data in Excel
-   add to Power Pivot
-   look at the data model and create relationships
- create a pivot table from that data
- create calculated columns in the data model
- create measures and add to a pivot table

## Words of warning

- Power Pivot is glitchy
-   Power Pivot in Excel is still officially supported, but has been largely replaced by Power BI
    -   I'd be very circumspect about its long-term prospects
    -   I'd also be cautious about starting more ambitious projects in Power Pivot
-   That said, knowing a bit of Power Pivot is definitely worthwhile - especially if you're not able to use Power BI etc

## Nutshell

-   PowerPivot = effectively a [local SSAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/ssas-overview?view=asallproducts-allversions)
-   that means PowerPivot allows you to do fancy relational work with your data
-   it *can* also means higher performance with large (10k rows +) data
-   yet allows you to use Excel for data ingest and output

## Data

-   download the [Agatha Christie dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8ZRe5KLLAllhT31pCzke4j5qAPqeMKf0jYgyJXcoPs/edit#gid=564606948) as an Excel file
-   tidying:
    -   remove filters </br>![Remove filters](images/clipboard-835331234.png)
    -   create 4 x named tables for each of the four main data sheets:
        -   `novels`
        -   `short_stories`
        -   `short_story_collections`
        -   `all_titles`

## Add data to Power Pivot

-   find Power Pivot in the ribbon menu
-   now add each table in turn to your data model </br> ![Add four tabhles to the data model](images/clipboard-657264833.png)

## The data view

-   data view </br>![data view](images/clipboard-3263737736.png)

## The diagram view

-   diagram view </br>![diagram view](images/clipboard-4246528073.png)

## Relationships

-   you can create relationships between different parts of your data
-   that's useful as you can then exploit those relationships using DAX formulas
-   open the diagram view, and connect the other three `Title ID` columns to `all_titles[Title ID]` </br>![Build relationships](images/clipboard-4256752901.png){height="400px"}
- Relationships have directions: with thanks to Michael Robb, NHS Highland, you can use the `Manage relationships` option to edit the filter direction

## Make a Pivot Table

-   this should feel nice and familiar: please insert a pivot table (from Power Pivot)
-   that should bring up a nearly-standard set of pivot table tools. One immediate difference though: you can work across several tables </br>![Several data sources in one pivot table](images/clipboard-3068291267.png)

## Make a Pivot Table

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![Pivot table fields](images/clipboard-3092995500.png)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![Output](images/clipboard-45311937.png)

## DAX

- Power Pivot is based on DAX (**D**ata **A**nalysis e**X**pressions)
- similar to Excel formula language
- a major difference: you can't reference individual cells
- we'll use structured references: `table[column]`

## Make a new column

-   `=MROUND(short_story_collections[Year of first publication], 10)`
-   rename to `Decade`
-   refresh your pivot table, and add a decade column

## Fancier calculated columns with DAX

-   add a series col to your all_titles data
-   `=related(novels[Series]) & related(short_stories[Series])` </br> ![Series column DAX](images/clipboard-515038106.png)

## Fancier calculated columns with DAX

-   add a `publication_year` column to your short_story data
-   ``` =LOOKUPVALUE(``short_story_collections``[Year of first publication],``short_story_collections``[Title Name], short_stories[Collection]) ``` </br> ![Publication year](images/clipboard-579564219.png)

## Calculated columns work as ordinary pivot table data

-   remember to refresh the data
-   you may also need to re-create your pivot table if you add tables/relationships: glitchy!

## Creating measures

-   another way of using DAX to create values
-   insert from the Power Pivot menu: </br>![Insert measure](images/clipboard-3327636246.png)
-   then populate with a simple DAX calculation: `=AVERAGE(ssc[Number of stories])`
- note the Table Name (which is where your measure will live)</br>![Create measure](images/clipboard-3534424614.png)

## Using measures

- you can then insert your measure in a Pivot Table
- first refresh your pivot table
- then look in the table you set as the Table Name to find your measure: ![Table Name](images/clipboard-2005550216.png)
- now drag the measure to the `Values` field, and then populate `Rows` with `short_story_collection[Decade]` ![Pivot table with measure](images/clipboard-3383725040.png)
