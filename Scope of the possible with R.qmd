## Welcome

-   this session is a **non-technical overview** designed for service leads
-   we'll get going properly at 15.05
-   if you can't access the chat, you might need to join our Teams channel

## Future sessions {.smaller}

```{r}
KINDR::training_sessions(tr_type = "R", start_date = params$date, n = 5)
```


## Session outline

-   Why R, and why this session?
-   R demo - take some data, load, tidy, analyse
-   Strengths and weaknesses
    -   obvious
    -   less obvious
-   Alternatives
-   Skill development

## R

-   free and open-source
-   multi-platform
-   large user base
-   prominent in health, industry, biosciences

## Why this session?

-   R can be confusing
    - it's code-based, and most of us don't have much code experience
    - it's used for some inherently complicated tasks
    - it's a big product with lots of add-ons and oddities
- But R is probably the best general-purpose toolbox we have for data work at present
    - big user base in health and social care
    - focus on health and care-like applications
    - not *that* hard to learn
    - extensible and flexible
    - capable of enterprise-y, fancy uses

## R demo

+ this is about showing what's possible, and give you a flavour of how R works
+ we won't explain code in detail during this session
+ using [live open data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/weekly-accident-and-emergency-activity-and-waiting-times) </br> ![https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/weekly-accident-and-emergency-activity-and-waiting-times](images/clipboard-776150275.png)

## Load that data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ae_activity <- read_csv("data/weekly_ae_activity_20240609.csv")
```

## One small bit of cheating: renaming

```{r}
names(ae_activity) <- c("date", "country", "hb", "loc", "type", "attend", "n_within", "n_4", "perc_4", "n_8", "perc_8", "n_12", "perc_12")
```


## Preview

```{r}
#| echo: false
ae_activity |>
    slice_sample(n = 5) |>
    knitr::kable(caption = "Preview of data")

```

## Removing data
```{r}
ae_activity <- ae_activity |>
    select(!c(country, contains("perc_")))

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
ae_activity |>
    slice_sample(n = 5) |>
    knitr::kable(caption = "Preview of data")

```

## Tidying data
```{r}
ae_activity <- ae_activity |>
    mutate(date = ymd(date))

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
ae_activity |>
    slice_sample(n = 5) |>
    knitr::kable(caption = "Preview of data")

```


## Subset data
+ we'll take a random selection of 5 health boards to keep things tidy

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
boards <- ae_activity |>
    distinct(hb) |>
    slice_sample(n = 5) |>
    pull()

```


```{r}
ae_activity <- ae_activity |>
    filter(hb %in% boards)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
ae_activity |>
    slice_sample(n = 5) |>
    knitr::kable(caption = "Preview of data")

```

## Basic plots
```{r}
ae_activity |>
    ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(x = date, y = attend, colour = hb, group = loc)) 

```

## Joining data
```{r}
ae_activity |>
    left_join(read_csv("data/boards_data.csv"), by = c("hb" = "HB")) |>
    select(!any_of(c("_id", "HB", "HBDateEnacted", "HBDateArchived", "Country"))) |>
    ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(x = date, y = attend, colour = HBName, group = loc))
```

## and again...
```{r}
#| include: false

loc_dat <- read_csv("data/postcodes.csv")

postcodes <- loc_dat |>
    pull(Postcode) |>
    unique() 

loc_dat_long <- map(postcodes, PostcodesioR::postcode_lookup) |>
    purrr::list_rbind() |>
    select(postcode, longitude, latitude)

ae_activity_loc <- loc_dat_long |>
    left_join(loc_dat, by = c("postcode" = "Postcode")) |>
    filter(!is.na(HospitalName)) |>
    select(!c(`_id`, contains("address"), HealthBoard, HSCP, CouncilArea, IntermediateZone, DataZone)) |>
    left_join(ae_activity, by = c("HospitalCode" = "loc")) |>
    filter(!is.na(date))

ae_activity_loc |>
    write_rds("data/ae_activity_loc.rds")

```

## Add to a map

```{r}
ae_activity_loc |>
    leaflet::leaflet() |>
    leaflet::addTiles() |>
    leaflet::addMarkers(~longitude, ~latitude, label = ~HospitalName)

```


## Then make that map more useful

```{r}
ae_activity_loc |>
    group_by(HospitalName) |>
    summarise(attend = sum(attend), n_within = sum(n_within), longitude = min(longitude), latitude = min(latitude)) |>
    mutate(rate = paste(HospitalName, "averages", scales::percent(round(n_within / attend, 1)))) |>
    leaflet::leaflet() |>
    leaflet::addTiles() |>
    leaflet::addMarkers(~longitude, ~latitude, label = ~rate)
```

## Then add to reports, dashboards...

## Strengths

-   enormous scope and flexibility
-   a force-multiplier for fancier data work
    - helps collaboration within teams, between teams, between orgs
    - reproducible analytics
    - modular approaches to large projects
-   decreasing pain curve: the fancier the project, the better


## Weaknesses

-   harder to learn than competitors
-   very patchy expertise across H+SC Scotland
-   complex IG landscape
-   messy skills development journey
