## The KIND network

-   a social learning space for staff working with **k**nowledge, **i**nformation, and **d**ata across health, social care, and housing in Scotland
-   we offer social support, free training, mentoring, community events, ...
-   [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a) / [mailing list](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5JmpopIZB9ynRJnrPUHVFccipURjM2NkZJUkhGOFlQRjQxRFhVUTgwT0UwVyQlQCN0PWcu)

## Session outline

-   Why Power BI, and why this session?
-   Power BI demo - build a simple dashboard
-   Strengths and weaknesses
    -   obvious
    -   less obvious
-   Alternatives
-   Skill development

## Power BI?

-   newish (c.2015)
-   based on Microsoft's SQL reporting products
    -   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for
-   integrates functions from several other Microsoft data products (bits of Excel, PowerPivot, PowerQueryâ€¦)
-   produces interactive dashboards

## Why this session?

-   there is a lot of fluff talked about Power BI
    -   e.g. elaborate visualisations, fancy real-time data products...
-   Power BI in general is promoted as a no-code tool
    -   that's just not true, as we'll see
-   Power BI has a sales-y focus
    -   that conceals some of its most useful properties
-   so Power BI, as a platform, requires some translation to the complicated reality of health and social care data
    -   and Power BI offers real strengths in managing and exploiting our data, even when the pain-points are taken into account

## Power BI demo

-   using [GP practice size data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes)

. . .

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("data/SotP_dat.csv") |>
    slice_sample(n = 3) |>
    knitr::kable()
```

::: notes
really nice tidy data needed
:::

## Load some data

![Lots of different data loading options](src/images/clipboard-1095239384.png)

## Preview

![Friendly tools for previewing data](src/images/clipboard-570198799.png)

## Add to a map

![Clever use of commercial postcode data](src/images/clipboard-1608638999.png)

## Add interactions

![Visualisations are interactive](src/images/clipboard-1372596463.png)

## Publish

![Publish button in ribbon menu](src/images/clipboard-3096192703.png)

## Add more visuals

![30-odd built in, hundreds of free additional visuals, thousands of (often dodgy) commercial add-ins](src/images/clipboard-2549253369.png)

## Add more data

-   we could add the [health board names](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/geography-codes-and-labels/resource/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc), to make our visual more useful
-   we could also get [GP practice demographics](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-populations)

## Add more data
![Totally different data, but harmonised process for loading](src/images/clipboard-2157605622.png)

## Re-shape that data

![Neatly-integrated PowerQuery, gives loads of scope for tidying and fixing data](src/images/clipboard-256142195.png)

## Data modelling tools

![Full suite of relational tools for the more ambitious projects](src/images/clipboard-1503081705.png)

## Pre-packed visuals

![Microsoft's Tornado chart](src/images/clipboard-3368145622.png)

## Demographics

![These can be cross filtered to give national/board/practice level insights](src/images/clipboard-3099396019.png)

## Strengths

-   by far the easiest way of producing interactive data products
-   great tools for tidying data
-  good for iterative projects
-   data hubbing / self-service data
-   scaling
-   potential to manage complex and sensitive data on existing infrastructure

## Weaknesses

-   really needs clean and tidy data - or PowerQuery expertise
-   publication can be complicated and expensive
-   steepening pain curve. Easy to start projects, but more involved analysis is messy
-   complex IG landscape
-   messy skills development journey
