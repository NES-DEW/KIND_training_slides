## Why?
+ most of us spend too much time doing repetitive tasks
    + e.g. data analysts [spending 50-80% of their time hand-tidying data](https://openproceedings.org/2016/conf/edbt/paper-94.pdf)
+ Power Automate helps automate processes

## Session outline

-   a warning
-   an introduction
-   scope of the possible
-   three example tasks
-   free chat

## A word of warning

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Warning

Do not use Power Automate for anything unless you're absolutely sure that your organisational policies permit it
:::

-   many boards and orgs have serious information governance and information security objections to Power Automate
    -   automation tools are an excellent way to break your data
    -   they're also an excellent way to compromise its integrity/security
    -   especially true if you're thinking about automating processes with sensitive information
    -   if in any doubt, speak to your IG/Caldicott/information security colleagues before setting to work

## Quick introduction to Power Automate

-   [Power Automate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_Automate) is a set of low-code automation tools
-   allows users to automate tasks
-   lots of options
    -   [web](https:://www.powerautomate.com) and [desktop versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/desktop-flows/install)
    -   several [different subscription levels](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-automate/#Pricing)
    -   hundreds of add-ons

## Scope of the possible

-   Power Automate is an extremely useful tool for H&SC
-   but you should be aware of some complicating factors for people like us:
    -   [massive and confusing](https://make.powerautomate.com/environments/Default-10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a/templates) range of different templates and use-cases, often with a business-focus
    -   a thick layer of promotional AI talk over everything at present (early 2025)
    -   unexpected cost/IG barriers to using parts of the platform
    -   glitchy, and often requiring more coding skills than you might expect
    -   [generally shockingly poor documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/)

## This session = honest, application-focused, introduction

-   we'll build three example flows that will:
    1.  take an Excel workbook, extract some parts of it, and save as a new Excel file
    2.  turn a response to Microsoft Forms into a Teams post
    3.  turn an Excel workbook into a simple mailing list

## Subset an Excel file

-   you'll need a sample data file - I used [this open data about council assets from Falkirk](https://opendata.scot/datasets/falkirk+council-council+asset+register+-+falkirk/)
-   I coverted the data to a table, then saved the workbook to OneDrive
-   `New flow > Instant cloud flow` </br>![Instant cloud flow](src/images/clipboard-1863368884.png)
